# Poleski Design Component Library

Well I'm tired of having to recreate the same components over and over so I figured I'd make my own Design Component Library for Vue 3 components. These components are free to use wherever you feel like.

### Details:
- Monorepo built on TurboRepo
- TailwindCSS
- CVA
- Storybook
- Iconify
- Built with Vite
- Modeled/Inspired on Flowbite
- UI components multiple install options
	- Install full UI package
	- Install individual component package
- Playground for Vite

### Todo:
- Add testing library
- Fill out example Button package
- Playground for Nuxt

### Running:
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm build`

#### Run Storybook
- `cd packages/ui`
- `pnpm storybook`

#### Run Playground
- `cd apps/vue-playground`
- `pnpm dev`
